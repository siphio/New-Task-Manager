# Reference Themes

Store exported theme files here for reference when customizing your main theme.

## Usage

2. Save it as a `.css` file in this folder (e.g., `cool-tones.css`)
3. Reference the color values when updating `src/index.css`

## Files

- `cool-tones.css` - (add your tweakcn export here)

## Notes
